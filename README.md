# Camera Model Identification
Source code to the [IEEE's Signal Processing Society - Camera Model Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification) hosted by Kaggle.

This solution is modeled after Pavel Ostyakov's [5th place solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification/discussion/49334) with significant tweaks of my own.

The competition was launched well before I began working on my solution, but serves as a fun point of reference for me to practice on computer vision related problems.
